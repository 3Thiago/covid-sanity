# covid-sanity

This small flask app organizes bioarxiv papers about COVID-19 and makes them searchable, sortable, etc.

Effectively a search interface on top of the [bioarxiv page](https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181)

Follows my previous project in spirit, [arxiv-sanity](https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver)
